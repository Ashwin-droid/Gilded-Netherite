You may: Download the mod from CurseForge and add it to your modpacks, 
as long as the mod is downloaded at runtime instead of being bundled as part of the modpack download. 
CurseForge modpacks created using the Twitch launcher (or upcoming Overwolf-owned CurseForge launcher) 
meet this requirement under normal circumstances.

You may not: Redistribute, modify, or otherwise share or alter the files provided by this project in any way.

While we do our best to avoid serious bugs, we take no responsibility for our mods eating your cat, 
burning down your house, spawning a demon from the 7th circle of Hell, or any other possible negative effects.
